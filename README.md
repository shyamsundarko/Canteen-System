This is the first project I did at NTU and the following points are my takeaways:
1) I feel like this is an effective way to learn a new programming language. Knowing that we have to work on this project with little to no prior knowledge lead to a lot of self-directed learning. Working in teams to complete this project was also greatly beneficial because we learnt from each other.
2) I learnt Python GUI through several video tutorials. Implementing so many different aspects of Python in the program, although challenging, was actually very interesting. 
3) File Handling through Python, implementation of calendar and using datetime module were my key takeaways from this project. 

_\**Introduction**\_\
The framework used in this program is tkinter. Included in the working of the program:
1) A python file named "data.py" which is a dictionary for storing operating hours
2) Menu folder with text files of the different restaurant menus
3) Images folder which consists of the background images for the various pages
